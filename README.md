# Adèles and idèles of global fields

By [María Inés de Frutos-Fernández](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.de-frutos-fernandez).

We formalize the finite adèle ring and finite idèle group of a Dedekind domain. Building on this, we formalize the (finite) adèle ring and (finite) idèle group of any number field or function field.

In the number field case, we moreover define the idèle class group and provide two applications: the statement of the main theorem of global class field theory, and a proof that the ideal class group is isomorphic to an explicit quotient of the idèle class group.

As a prerequisite, we formalize adic valuations on Dedekind domains and the associated completions.

## Installation instructions
The formalization has been developed over Lean 3 and its matemathical library `mathlib`. For detailed instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and supporting tools, visit the [Lean Community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

After installation, run the command `leanproject get mariainesdff/ideles` to obtain a copy of the project's source files and dependencies. To open the project in VS Code, either run `path/to/ideles` on the command line, or use the "Open Folder" menu option to open the project's root directory.

## Documentation

The documentation automatically generated from the source file of the project is available on [this link](https://mariainesdff.github.io/ideles). Note that it includes documentation for the version of mathlib used by the project.

See also [Lean's general documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/) and the [current mathlib docs](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs).
